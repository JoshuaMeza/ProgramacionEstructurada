  #Using the module function we compare the result with 0, that means _Number is even or odd
  #The _typeNumber is even when the module give us 0 and odd when is >0, in the moment when the _Number
  #is a even number the value of the flag change and if is not == 0 then the flag still being the same
  #This function returns the value of _typeNumber because we are going to use it for the output

   #Using the value of _typeNumber we have the output of our program

#Input: A integer Number
Number=0
typeNumber=0

#Process: Determines if the module of 2 of Number is 0, which means that is an even number
#Then the value of typeNumber change to 1, which for this program represents even and 0 represents odd
typeNumber= calculateTypeNumber(Number)

#Output: 1 for even Number or 0 for odd Number
